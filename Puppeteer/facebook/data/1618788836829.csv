"/scanhealthplan/?refid=52&__tn__=%7E%7E-R","November 9, 2020 at 6:47 PM ¬∑ ","2021 Insulin Savings Program Q&A According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, about one in five Americans aged 65 years and over is living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. For these people, having access to insulin is essential to being able to live healthy and independent lives. Unfortunately, that access can be expensive. Which is why SCAN Health Plan chose to participate in an innovative new program designed to make insulin more affordable to older Americans. As an enthusiastic supporter of the new Medicare Part D Insulin Savings Plan, SCAN Health Plan is embracing a price cap on insulin that is expected to save seniors about $500 each year in 2021.  In this Q&A, Sharon Jhawar, SCAN Health Plan‚Äôs chief pharmacy officer, explains why SCAN is taking these steps and what the program means for SCAN members who rely on insulin. - Why did SCAN Health Plan choose to participate in this program? At SCAN, we have long advocated for lower prescription drug prices, and this particular program is an important step in the right direction. About 10% of SCAN members take insulin regularly and addressing the cost barrier of this life-saving drug helps ensure that they can remain healthy and independent‚Äîregardless of their socioeconomic status.  - The insulin program is run by the federal government, which called for reducing the cost of insulin for many people to $35 for a month‚Äôs supply. But many of SCAN‚Äôs plans drop it even further. That‚Äôs correct. We chose to use the federal program as more of a guideline than a rule. As a result, many of our plans for 2021 have a monthly $25 copay for insulin. And our SCAN Balance (HMO SNP) plans, which is specially designed to focus on the needs of people with diabetes, will come with a $0 insulin copay. So, as you can see, our goal was to match our members‚Äô needs with real affordability. - What about the Medicare ‚Äúdonut hole?‚Äù Will people end up paying more for insulin after a few months? No. For SCAN members on these plans, there will be no Part D coverage gap, otherwise known as ‚Äúthe donut hole.‚Äù No matter how much your other medications may cost, your insulin copay will stay constant. In this way we‚Äôre taking some of the guesswork and unpredictability out of drug costs. - How is making insulin more affordable linked to SCAN‚Äôs mission to help seniors live healthy lives? Many studies have shown that when people can afford their medications, they‚Äôre more likely to take them. We don‚Äôt want our members to skip necessary medications for any reason. - People with diabetes rely on different types of insulin to keep them healthy. Do these copays only apply to a specific formula or type of insulin? Not at all. That just wouldn‚Äôt make sense, because we know that not every person is the same, and not every person reacts the same way to every formulation of insulin. That‚Äôs why these copays will apply to insulin pens and vials and a variety of formulations on our formulary including Humalog, Humulin, Lantus, Lyumjev and Toujeo. - How can SCAN members obtain insulin under the plan? Do they have to go to a special pharmacy? The insulin copays will apply when our members fill their prescriptions at a network pharmacy. Members can save even more when filling at SCAN Preferred pharmacies, which include CVS and Rite Aid. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our members prefer home delivery services, so we recommend they fill their prescriptions using Express Scripts Pharmacy, which will deliver a 3-months‚Äô supply of insulin right to members‚Äô doors. There‚Äôs no charge for standard shipping and members are notified when it‚Äôs time for a refill.   - How can people with diabetes learn more about the cost of insulin with SCAN Health Plan? The best thing to do is to call SCAN at 1-877-210-7226 (TTY: 711) and talk to one of our representatives about your needs or speak to your broker. Everyone on the SCAN team is knowledgeable about Medicare Advantage plans and knows how to match people with the right plan. Current SCAN members can call our helpful Member Service Advocates at 1-800-559-3500 (TTY: 711). . . . SCAN Health Plan is an HMO plan with a Medicare contract. Enrollment in SCAN Health Plan depends on contract renewal. Other pharmacies are available in our network.

"/thehumantrial/?refid=52&__tn__=%7E%7E-R","May 4, 2020 at 11:07 AM ¬∑ ","Repost ‚Ä¢ @wrxelina One day I‚Äôm going to wake up and be able to tell a stranger that I USED TO BE A TYPE 1 DIABETIC. This coming week will be my 19-year ‚Äúdiaversary.‚Äù And most of my diabetic life, I was a bad diabetic... really, really bad. I ignored it, was in denial and pretended it didn‚Äôt exist for me. So much so that it almost took my life, TWICE, within 6 months of each episode of #DKA. That‚Äôs how mad I was at God for giving me this obstacle, this 24/7 job, this burden - that made me feel belittled and that people looked at me different. But I could only ignore my diabetes for so long. 4 years ago, I chose to go on an insulin pump (not pictured), which helped, but I was still a bad diabetic. It was only as recent as February 2019 where I decided to get a continuous glucose monitor. My #CGM changed my life. For the first time in my diabetic life, I have an #A1C of 6.4%. NEVER have I ever had an A1C so stable, let alone under the suggested 7% every T1 diabetic should be at or under. I struggled and I persevered through a lot. But this obstacle had to be given to me or I wouldn‚Äôt be the person I am now. I can confidently say I‚Äôm type 1 strong, without fear of the future.  This is just food for thought. A very personal post but because it‚Äôs my anniversary of my diagnosis, I wanted to share. And I‚Äôm only scratching the surface. So if you actually read this post, thank you. But more than anything, while I pray for a cure, I‚Äôd do anything to fight the insulin manufacturers and their price gauging of insulin. People shouldn‚Äôt have to die because their medication is unforgivably expensive to pay. It‚Äôs a denial of life and is unjust.  #diabetes #t1d #thisiswhatdiabeteslookslike #beyondtype1 #diabadass #t1dstrong #insulin #novolog #humalog #dexcom #omnipod #racetothecure #thehumantrial #obeyawareness #juvenilediabetes","39","https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=3201622023204954&refid=52&__tn__=-R",undefined,"5 Shares","3201622023204954",https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3201622023204954&id=287015347998984&__xts__%5B0%5D=12.Abprgf8W5j6Q6_82k1vgP38t59w5W9QC_LHJou0GPQMiackdkUZDS3l8PpePb7mWq8OMa4XMm5zTEeVF6TRWOa1qO10wDRBoKR5pLIgP8BaOscDPsUFS0VXgLW_GUWpWhz4bir1QjYsnnHfNEzW5rAmPOI1SRerpCezbjodqFjrJONXj3BjtNGrz26mKYC9Ommqd8ziUBksbqT7ZWagd2KlEfX2nE76K33CT9Ar0neHKEiJJjQMsvYu-WBbEQC7nRHxvmvNXbdS7_W9JvMGeR1GBNU28OY8KfjsxbFoFTv0n103_FCLGTc2onGdIK2LFqWC7EqkmQRXURjqtamvf63yi2FmuQZXM9NFVw2ca4bQiYYQTzOX9rxxIC5ekawEsiJE
