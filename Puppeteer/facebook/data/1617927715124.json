Really???? Derek Chauvin's attorney Eric Nelson is chipping away at the of video to create “reasonable doubt.” He is questioning the “real cause” of George Floyd’s death. He argues that Floyd died of a cardiac arrest resulting from drug use & pre-existing health issues, including heart disease & high blood pressure. Not an inability to breathe. Translation: George wasn't murdered. He died because of his drug use & his weak and ailing body. Can you see it? More blame the victim. It's NEVER them. It's ALWAYS us. Our fault. Our poor health. Our drug use. Our diabetes. If George had just “cooperated” Chauvin would not have HAD to use force. This is the logic of White Supremacy. White hate is ALWAYS right & the Black Body is ALWAYS wrong. As far as the prosecution is concerned, we ALWAYS bring their hate on ourselves. They. Are. Wrong. Whether or not Chauvin’s jury buys into “reasonable doubt” we need to get our hearts & minds right for a not guilty verdict. I'm serious. Like you, I'm praying for a guilty verdict with the maximum sentence possible, but I'm a realist. White Hate/White Supremacy is so part of America’s DNA, I don't trust they will see what the world saw as we watched the breath leave George’s body. White Privilege almost always finds a to protect itself. The jury may conclude from the “evidence” that George was not murdered. So the question becomes: after the rage because there will be red-hot rage, what do we do to effect real change?

Low carb chili, low carb garlic bread, and pepperoni cheese bites that I made in a muffin pan in the oven. Total carbs: 8. Total protein: 95 grams.  Did you hear?  The ADA changed their recommendations for children with diabetes.  They previously recommended an A1c of 7.5% (average blood sugar of 190) and now they suggest an A1c of 7.0% (an average blood sugar of 172).  The decision to lower their A1c targets is due to the mounting evidence that “chronically elevated levels of blood glucose can cause several detrimental effects including abnormal brain development, increased heart problems (e.g. coronary or peripheral heart diseases, stroke), other diabetes related complications (e.g. diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy), and increased mortality rates in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.”  My interpretation:  We know high blood sugars are bad for you.  We are going to suggest that you shave 18 points off of your average blood sugar and still run more than TWICE what normal blood sugars are for someone without diabetes.  We aren’t going to give you a new strategy nor will we change our food recommendations.  We also aren’t going to send out a mass communication to let everyone know about this change and that they need to take high blood sugars seriously.  Instead we will provide a new metric and allow your doctor to scold you for not achieving it or giving you the tools (that a MASSIVE agency like the ADA could certainly provide) in terms of nutrition counseling.  We must wait to have enough randomized studies to show that healthy low carb food is good for kids with an incurable metabolic disorder caused by an attack on their immune system.   I think I’m done now.  #letmebe83 So many requests for recipes. Ha!  Garlic bread: heavily butter smart buns and add garlic and mozzarella cheese. Bake for 8 min and then broil it to get it brown and bubbly.  Pizza bites:  take muffin pan and spray with avocado oil. Add mozzarella cheese and bake for 8 min at 350.  Then, add a pepperoni and more cheese and Italian herbs and bake again until melted.  Dunk in chili.  🙂","likes":"248","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=3764396193658803&refid=52&__tn__=-R","shares":"6 Shares","postid":"3764396193658803","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3764396193658803&id=450893605009095&__xts__%5B0%5D=12.Abpu9ddI8JAzEJxNJ8EOkXAHAkie0cIouNstZ7vDimFhPctjU9vhAKdTjgDE26pHT8ryQloNhdaN8Ld7mmB1KPw_UayXeJFiGsyO9iLMdIbSS_ehw1uLy58VgjKgv-tCN_AS4d039P-jS6QP2HP4Vg9jniDKT-HE9juMZswa1WtcuBeTfYoB3Va4eRlY_It36y9TU0E3sq2mVGPtygRc-mlgFlt3FX6N4C7snz4M9m_8RnypB7BLCPq-jrOMX0FDfB4HfkTkdRrSSfagQKmq5KijaFYIuZlmWkuV3o9mTnaClTwQ9QAYiISPVr5yNPsqKO29Dbpi4jPAeODsiAMrpJQBlKtzmwmKNAhtwFa7u_3GM8QPoVxWJ2iZcPAwII4hdMg"},{"profile_link":"/SjogrensFoundation/?refid=52&__tn__=%7E%7E-R","datetime":"7 hrs · ","content":"Isabel 28 (diagnosed at 20) My most difficult Sjögren’s symptoms are dry eyes, dry mouth, joint pain, fatigue, brain fog and peripheral neuropathy.

I got back Monday from my grands and that night I was having some pain in my left ribs. Took some Tylenol a couple times and got enough sleep. At school on Tuesday, I felt “off” all day, level 3 pain in ribs, couldn’t get a deep breath, so I took meds and got through my day. No big deal. At 3:30 I was finishing up some reports at my computer and the pain became much worse in a few minutes time. I started down the hallway to my car to head to a clinic and my AP asked if I was ok and I was decidedly NOT ok in that little span of time! I was in so much pain I could not draw a breath, which made me panic, which causes...pain.  Our school nurse, Chantal was there, assessing me and called 911, the ambulance came and by that time I was in agony and I couldn’t breathe. So scary! My principal, Sara and our Assistant principal molly, were there giving me comfort and care. They followed the ambulance and stayed with me until my boys got there.  Both my boys, Skyler and Shey drove from ft. Worth to Plano that evening and were a tremendous comfort and help, getting my meds and driving me home and making sure I ate something.  So for all that, the diagnosis itself was not serious (ribs pinching nerves and radiating around the whole place) and I’m getting neuropathy treatment for it. I’m off the heavy meds and will return to work tomorrow.  Sometimes, things happen that you have zero ability to help yourself with. So God sends angels, some you know, some are strangers, to minister to you. I’m so very thankful my teachers who reached out and let me know they were thinking about me and for every person who gave of their time and medical skills and prayers for me.  I’m truly grateful.","likes":"36","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=3897722990282721&refid=52&__tn__=-R","shares":"","postid":"3897722990282721","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3897722990282721&id=100001351766447&__xts__%5B0%5D=12.AbqQSURSR90Zc8zuaqUmANeAwH6u8P1RfrFZGhxrZsKxw_WxarkZsbiYT61QYC13BrXr43IbqaYr5p8MlkStfDigerkfc3LT998IJQ-xWPi3nuKO04afVKfhiQ2RGuReMeIZOEq-xvByY0DjroQZcvv0hcqFLBYEHotRmq5uo-5jZp037n5JPxgVc_NIcbt7CUhtZ2OSuDtQ4QObb0EeFEj14nFgrKyZyp6R9E8pnjyBLorGoI7r0HKwS59mz3R_xAw7pa7MVYccPizxp8K2k5o6i1ujfWBiz9aoKDUP_-Z5YjlLBa8loQdWSNhVTFrJUB4-TrYr8YTtSQEbpUDGvdfnPfbPLLCjAVQK31iOr0Z8BYZsqOixaHyOzfsnZlmHS-w"},{"profile_link":"/cj.cherryh?fref=nf&refid=52&__tn__=%7E-R","datetime":"Yesterday at 1:28 PM · ","content":"I post this, not to complain too much, because, oh, am I glad to be ABLE to be above ground and able to do just about anything I want to do, but this neuropathy thing is a weasel---not so much a bear as a weasel. It comes and it goes. One day, typing is easy. At least two of my fingers are fairly normal, the little one and the ring finger. The next day, they're all hypersensitive, even my own fingernails hurt, and every third letter I type is an error. Over a lifetime of training I cannot just let them go and spellcheck: that makes me even crazier when spellcheck can't recognize the words. Reaching into cold water---working with the pond---a total ow! and recourse to the handwarmer. Spring has been very slow this year, and I spend a lot of time with that handwarmer. Things that help, for those suffering the same: a med, given by my doc, a relative of Lyrica; a hand cream that has CBD oil (I don't know if the CBD helps, but it feels good); a hand warmer; lace-over-ankle hiking boots by KKYC that stabilize my feet especially on a bad day and enable me to stride normally; and Advil. AND being careful not to abuse my hands by picking up 40 pound bags. I'm through with my second course of the med. I've had to be very good while taking it this last 180 days and almost all of last year it was either the chemo itself or waiting for it to get out of my system---no alcohol, no riotous living at all. I'll have to wait a little for the med to clear my system, and then I intend to enjoy one modest glass of wine from that lovely bottle that's been sitting there for the last while. Today is not the best day for my fingers. But not totally bad either. It's a slow progress and you just don't know with neuropathy. Sometimes it never goes away. Sometimes it's a few months. A few years. We'll see. I am outrageously happy that I can type. I'm being good and not stressing the fingers gardening. I just LOOK at situations that I want to go after. And grumble. The fish tank is an ongoing project. SOMETHING got into the tank that has it foaming like mad from the skimmer---a device that produces foam (amino acids) from the water to remove the pollutant---but this is like soap. Like bubble bath. And I know that's not the case.  This should go away. Jane very kindly and patiently scooped foam out and tossed it last evening. WHatever it is, I haven't had the nerve to go down to the basement and look this morning, but all the fish are alive. The anemone is in hiding, but I think it's alive.","likes":"351","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=3980397732016467&refid=52&__tn__=-R","shares":"","postid":"3980397732016467","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3980397732016467&id=100001388388399&__xts__%5B0%5D=12.Abp0ApczS0D4KMqG2eFMhD6qNn1eZn-iaOOZ7_QKedFrOzrCgh57CIv68qbX3nB607ZfBeIRjwzNpLfKfnPyM-9wejzbEMs104d2w759TV5SolO5Au1Zi19VQbhppbBapztDMudheb1y62xIxBeX6s0kZaJeoD935NpbhSCtVKn6iWo4fuXx8Jl-eCWoIoImsaTHwAFAm4hEAOgXV6fWpkdtLPHclD_IefQdwEfq0cU73_I7sFr70WcfL9SVV2TvMVC_OvNps2gN0pSsgrDtCDKDS2BkLdvXx2nQyeX-Is__lj--8Rt9Lcw_fXfA8ewQDttWx_zHaT5UJeLrSGP78qBSlHO_SA2jfp4wqo-ogiN_YI5Ks1UHcTbHOtBLyFL3y0E"},{"profile_link":"/ClevelandClinic/?refid=52&__tn__=%7E%7E-R","datetime":"March 31 at 8:03 PM · ","content":"Pins and needles, tingling and burning pain.

This was all from a freak accident of fracturing my rib from swinging a softball bat with no contact during a time when I was in the best shape of my life. To say it bluntly... my life from that day on has never been the same. It’s been a constant battle of will and continuing to fight each day.  It’s been quite a journey seeing 8 specialists, probably 40 plus appointments, many trips to get my blood work done, CAT Scan, CT Scans, and MRI’s and still very little progress. Doctors telling me there’s nothing they can do... that this pain is in my head, but not really happening, or just feeling like more of a number and them not really digging beneath the surface to find the answers.  Symptoms over this time frame have ranged from numbness throughout the body at times, 24/7 tingling on my left side of my body from my left arm down to my feet, burning sensation in my feet, uncontrollable shaking, slurring of speech, barely being able to hold a glass, struggling to walk a block because of the burning sensation, memory loss, etc. I have averaged 4 hours of sleep a night with not one night where I slept through the night or one morning where I haven’t felt pain. The doctors had me on 5-7 prescriptions at a time, but once I made the choice to get off of them and choose some amazing vitamins... my health improved to where it was manageable.  There were days where I wanted to give up, but I am blessed to have my future wife, Rachel Grimoldi, in my life who has been my rock, my shoulder to lean on, and who has wiped my tears away when I was upset or the pain was unbearable. I wouldn’t be here today with a fresh perspective on life and a determination to find answers without her love and support. I want to be a survivor of this... so I can hold my children and play with them without feeling constant pain. I want to be able to be super active like I have always been because it helps my mental health and provides balance in my life.  People might ask why would I share this? Simply put... I want to help people who battle these same issues, but struggle to use their voice. I want to be a spokesperson on this down the road when I recover so I can provide hope for others who battle neuropathy and neurological issues daily.  Please send me some love and prayers today that I find the answers I need in order to get fully healthy so I can walk down the aisle for my wedding and my bride can look into my eyes and know that I am no longer in pain.  Happy Tuesday and I love you all!  #neuropathy #neurological #findinganswers #prayers #praying #physicalhealth","likes":"182","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=10100632094590905&refid=52&__tn__=-R","shares":"","postid":"10100632094590905","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10100632094590905&id=173400736&__xts__%5B0%5D=12.AbpOkaNxNdXZT5lUiGZsqBZLg5M3URVOK_9aF7P4i74p7B080VCuBgObEI_8uujBb7lw3vEY5hZrHaPEMNFsqv0vZoQvZfBptWLxpeMpmwGfpmIncqcH-k-wntv6wls2MkeOq46kZK4rYiPD_PK1Ge0gbxzmPPlYmoYbrQjYeC5AfEH_DIcMMO0jO9IPkyV9JuRR8nKSkmk6bgr1uZ2Zm0h6Xvx8H1qGFcd8HiYej8blQRuUmm5f_aLCbKdv4ZtjF0iMZsssfhead5JmIN5iCUBugKVhNCfSj4vOUBFw5r37ei7Iih8DVcw1hCugwfFWTmF4sPXlSudcwke9-u729YoT-DBOHdmoUBsva7CD_yG5g_rye6rJdCwOJ6TQQrGgBQQ"},{"profile_link":"","datetime":"","content":"","likes":"","likes_link":"","shares":"","postid":"1434146740269350","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1434146740269350&id=749230268761004&__xts__%5B0%5D=12.AbpbMgeQ3rRnosBrWw-YoBVsZsqHTsBFoLtDJQuwwlhdfAILb2UucSR_qEXngFjo6T1F1bLQMDbOyj5LfOROlp53IEy0usxpt042LAcO16NEXckMKbKD06o5ZisiH8auAG0-hVtF0ScvaCYY330tnCGYXX5SL0xfISdDn5_Aa62VqGxNorGsTt9ZaNwn3lybDOt0cWpzxo03_sHR363NjRWTvCbiSTpw9ZYBIeCEiJ0HqCSnCQxCP6qGo_4z4aGb55iE3k0kgAaUSAzK3nlKYL-TBjPIt2k7ow-s005KEN5wA5Nxiy3mrvFITwZ58gI4-fv4brZnKi80wfldeNpA7zi4tcIp245J7hg7vdqprzIgY8EVEwmqn9oCzchIy2F3jQY"},{"profile_link":"/BrownsShoeFitCoFtCo/?refid=52&__tn__=%7E%7E-R","datetime":"1 hr · ","content":"🔷The Brown’s Shoe Fit Ft.

Type 1 is an autoimmune disease. Type 2 is not. Type 2, however, accounts for over 95% of the diabetic cases in the United States, so it’s easy to be confused.  2. Type 1 is genetic, and there is nothing anyone can do to avoid it. It’s not caused from too much sugar or junk food. It is not curable (yet).  3. Type 1, like all autoimmune disorders, occurs when the body attacks itself (in this case, the pancreas). Often times type 1 diabetics have other autoimmune issues—which is why Levi is checked annually for Hashimoto’s disease and celiac.  4. There are no special potions, herbs, teas, diets or prayers which cure type-1 diabetes, but thanks for sharing. I’m sure those essential oils smell nice, but they won’t bring back insulin cells attacked by Levi’s immune system. 5. What the medical community knows about type-1 is constantly changing and progressing. What you thought you knew ten years ago is probably wrong today (as we have found out). Type-1 diabetics can eat whatever anyone else can eat (they just need insulin for it).  6. Type-1 kids want to be treated like everyone else. One of the most common cause of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis, which is deadly) is “burn out”: a child or teen is sick of being a diabetic and just decides to stop taking care of themselves because they want to “be normal”. The way others treat them has a huge impact on burn out. Bottom line: don’t treat a type-1 any different than a regular person who needs to monitor themselves more often than others.  7. Type-1 diabetics don’t count sugars, they count carbs. Every diabetic is originally given something called an “insulin to carb ratio”, or ICR, which is specific to that person based on individual factors like age, weight, and activity level—and it’s subject to change at every endocrinologist appointment. Right now, Levi’s ICR is 25 for breakfast and 30 for meals and snacks. (So if a bagel is 50 carbs, and peanut butter is 8, his total breakfast would be 58 carbs. You take 58 divided by his ICR, which is 25, which comes to 2.32. This means he would receive 2 units of insulin for breakfast, because you round up or down.) He does not need insulin for items less than 15 carbs if he is running around. If he’s running around AND the weather conditions are extreme, he gets about 30 “uncovered carbs” (meaning, no insulin, because exercise acts as a natural insulin). Anything under 8 carbs receives no insulin regardless of activity. (Cheese, meat, pickles, olives, and anything in the keto category are “free” foods.) (Note: We have been asked why type-1s dont just eat keto to prevent taking insulin shots. Some adult diabetics use keto but insulin is a growth hormone which growing bodies need; this is why undiagnosed or untreated diabetics eventually starve to death or are deemed “failure to thrive”. They don’t produce insulin and the body begins to eat its own fat and muscle. No one likes injections, but insulin is what keeps diabetics alive.) 8. Type-1s also have something called a “correction factor”, or CF. Levi’s is 60. What that means is if Levi’s glucose level is higher than his target (no lower than 70 and no higher than 120), when it’s time to eat a meal (not a snack), we have to make a correction to his insulin. So for example, if his blood sugar at dinner is 200 (which is rare), and he wants a hamburger (26 carbs) and fries (40 carbs), we have to give him insulin for the food he’s about to eat PLUS for the amount that he is OVER his target. For that particular meal we would calculate his hamburger (26 carbs) plus fries (40 carbs) which equal 66 carbs. 66 carbs (divided by 30, his ICR for lunch, dinner and snacks) usually gets 2.2 units or insulin (rounded down to 2). But oops, he started out at 200! So we take 200 minus his target (120) and get 80. 80 divided by his CF (60) gives us 1.3. Now we add 1.3 to 2.2 and get 3.5 units. (We round up to 4 units if we know he is going to be more active than usual.) He goes through these calculations every time he eats, but he only factors in corrections at meal times (3 hours apart). Correcting too frequently can cause very low blood sugars. Never correcting and having perpetually high blood sugars can cause serious and damaging side effects to organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, and others.  9. The “pump” pumps insulin directly into the body without constant injections from a pen or a syringe. The “continuous glucose monitor” (CGM) is a small device worn on the body for usually 10 days which reads blood sugar levels every five minutes (depending on the brand and model). These tools are helpful but they CAN and HAVE had problems and aren’t fool-proof. They decrease the amount you will need to poke yourself, but you still need to double check your numbers if there’s a problem. They are very, very expensive. 10. Type-1 diabetics use two kinds of insulin, a long acting and a short acting. Levi’s short acting insulin is called Humalog, which is what he uses to administer the above calculated doses whenever he eats. His long active insulin is called Lantus, and he takes that once every 24 hours. The dose for Lantus is much higher (right now, it’s 10 units at bed time).  Now you know!","likes":"29","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=2254085441388389&refid=52&__tn__=-R","shares":"","postid":"2254085441388389","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2254085441388389&id=100003608646600&__xts__%5B0%5D=12.Abquu4rFk4t6wnkvRCY1vLX63jKMYUTch1C4HEFp7Jje9zxgIakdGCDj-0G2LWnFBq41FALShGD-XGk4Mji7_BxvPrvef1BFNYo9jPqpQT55L7VvXq1OM0akKmRUGmhg-MqZv4HsRvuEqgwZzNqmQ63Xe6XfbC0KzYt-o52dErp2CRk80IO-sN5NHZMfG5m6CtRhcDoe1pLbfnYDJ5R24GhopeRyTG6MKBU8_NHDYFgQN1i2DafMZmH7B_i3hU7UWZRcuISt3IKgSmpkBaoYLLuLJOQdYJjJ4GLsEyjELEXUL2SbfeN-vwQHaFm1m7v8AF4QYmA59JqaiF_GpvaE78MIEP1l3MreIdtF9vjc7cLmWpWw23KF2Bc-W6RpmZSFSys"},{"profile_link":"/susan.heywood.52?fref=nf&refid=52&__tn__=%7E-R","datetime":"April 1 at 5:01 PM · ","content":"I am in between endocrinologists because of moving and mine left to start a practice in another state.
